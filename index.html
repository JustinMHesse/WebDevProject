            <h2>Gielenor</h2>

            <p class="info">
                Runescape takes place in the world of Gielenor, a medieval fantasy realm consisting of different
                regions, kingdoms, and cities. Gielenor was originally created by
                great beings called the Elder Gods, but as other Gods discovered the realm, many sought to ravage or
                claim it for themselves. It is the player's job as the World Guardian to ensure
                the safety of Gielenor by fighting monsters, slaying bosses, and becoming stronger. Each region of
                Gielenor offers different types of monsters to fight, resources to gather,
                and quests to improve the player's character.

            <h2>Combat and Skills</h2>
            <p class="info">
                There are a number of skills tied to the player's character. All skills start at level 1 but can be
                trained up to level 99 or 120, depending on the skill. Levelling up in these skills allows the player to
                do more things related to that skill.
                Some quests and high-level activities require certain levels in certain skills, so it is beneficial to
                every player to reach max level in all of them! A list of the current
                skills can be seen below:

            In addition to these skills, combat gear is another way of improving one's character. Runescape revolves
            around three style of combat; melee, ranged, and magic.
            Each of these combat styles has countless weapons and armor sets that can be used by the player. Some
            weapons and armor are stronger than others, while some gear may have
            niche uses where they excel. Some monsters may be weak to a certain combat style but resilient to
            another. To survive in the world of Gielenor, it is beneficial for a player
            to be a master of all three styles.
