            <h1>Bosses of Gielenor</h1>
            <p class="info">Slaying bosses is one of the fundamental parts of Runescape. Defeating them can reward the
                player with
                improved gear, and one of the most important things in Runescape; money! Called GP for gold-pieces,
                runescape players can never have enough money.
                GP is used to buy items from NPC vendors or from other players at the Grand Exchange. Bosses can drop
                expensive pieces of gear or ability upgrades after being defeated
                which players can either choose to keep for themselves and use, or sell to another player for GP.
                Defeating bosses is one of the best ways to make money in Gielenor!

                    Raksha was a normal dinosaur that had lived on Gielenor long ago. The creature stumbled upon a
                    powerful
                    elder artefact that imbued him with
                    immense power and turned him intelligent and savage. His power relied on a dark resource called
                    shadow
                    anima which had not been produced in ages, and
                    as a result, Raksha slipped into a coma for tens of thousands of years until the World Guardian
                    discovered and slayed him.

                    its
                    power. He was made into a powerful Guardian by the god Guthix.
                    An elite elf warrior named Erethdor learned of the powers of the Lost Grove and attacked Solak in
                    order
                    to claim it for himself. He was defeated, but as his body was destroyed
                    his mind split into two; one half of which was bound within Solak, corrupting the Guardian. The
                    World
                    Guardian discovered this tainted Solak, and was able to defeat him and expel
                    Erethdor from his mind.
